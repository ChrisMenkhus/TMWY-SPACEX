Now adays rocket boosters are flown multiple times and I thought it would be awesome to be able to see the previous missions of a booster. I used the /r/Spacex Reddit API as my data source and re-organized the data programmatically for my needs. I used Styled-components to simplify my CSS as many components are reused. 

3/4/22 edit: The SpaceX API is no longer updated and the schema has changed slightly so this site is a little buggy. Soon I want to remake this site with my new skills.
